## Examples

### Playwright example

```TypeScript
import { expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { test } from "@mocky-balboa/playwright";

test("a route that performs server and client network requests", async ({ page, mocky }) => {
  // Mocks the request on both the client and the server
  mocky.route("**/api/endpoint", (route) => {
    return route.fulfill({
      status: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello, World!" }),
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  }, {
    // Optionally configure the route
    // type: "both" to mock on both client and server (default behaviour)
    // type: "server-only" to mock on the server only
    // type: "client-only" to mock on the client only
  });

  await page.goto("http://localhost:3000");
});
```
